# MatrixCalculator
Making a calculator to help me with my linear algebra programming

Currently functional, but only has basic matrix operations.
To-do:
1. Implement currently placed operations
2. Implement operations involving eigenvectors

At some point I'll probably make a Fraction class/struct so that I don't have to use floats, which may cause issues because of how they are calculated.

DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIX IT BUT THE DETERMINANT DOES NOT WORK!!!
IT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SWAPPING
