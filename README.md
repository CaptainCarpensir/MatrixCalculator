# MatrixCalculator
Making a calculator to help me with my linear algebra programming

Currently functional, but only has basic matrix operations.
To-do:
1. Implement currently placed operations
2. Implement operations involving eigenvectors

At some point I'll probably make a Fraction class/struct so that I don't have to use floats, which may cause issues because of how they are calculated.
